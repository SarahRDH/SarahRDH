- 🧠 I already know HTML and CSS, a little bit of C and Bootstrap, and I plan to get into Python after I'm comfortable with JavaScript and React.
- 💬 Ask me about UI/UX for healthcare and dental professionals. I know what they want because <em>I used to be one</em>!
- 📫 How to reach me: https://sarahrdh.github.io/ or https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarah-johnson-84bb3ba3/
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her/hers
- ⚡ Fun facts: I was awarded first place in a state competition for Piano Performance when I was 18. 🏆 🎹 When I was 15 I took an after school class in Pascal.
